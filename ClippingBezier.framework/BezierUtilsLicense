I believe the original .h and .cpp files were from open source InkScape project

much of it came originally from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lib2geom/

including the clipping algorithm from:
https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape/blob/master/inkscape-launchpad/src/2geom/bezier-clipping.cpp

with code from http://lib2geom.sourceforge.net which is Mozilla Public License Version 1.1
